    <p>I am a masterfully trained web developer trained by Professor Caruso of RVCC. 
      I can create the most magnificent sites you have ever seen in your life with my
      undeniable talent and creativity. I have experience in the lastest HTML5 updates
      as well as CSS. I am very knowledgeable in using grid for my CSS designs and understand
      the importance of making the site function properly across different devices.
